        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Anna Niu and I am currently a first year at the University of California, Riverside.<br><br>

        I am majoring in Business Economics but have intentions of applying to the Business School here or at another university in California and would love to pursue something in the finance/marketing management field at a corporate technology company.<br><br>
        
        I enjoy interacting with and working with people as well as doing math-related things. I run an online clothing business that has taught me how to work with customers and make sales pitches. This account has also taught me how to stay organized by using softwares such as Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheets to keep track of my profits and inventory. I mainly source pieces that I think customers would enjoy, promote them on my page, that will in turn make profit.<br><br>
       
       Before coming into college, I also worked at a restaurant as a hostess, teaching me how to deal with customers in a professional setting. I was also trained on how to work with others. This job taught me to be strong and stand my ground, while also being competent and easygoing with both my coworkers and customers. After getting paid both my wage and tip money, I was able to learn how to budget my spendings. I saved up a majority of my money and was able to spend money on what I needed, instead of asking my parents for funds. While I have learned to work alone through my clothing company, this job has taught me to work in a group setting as well.<br><br>
       
       Growing up, I have always had a business and finance mindset. My family was not the most well off and in order to help relieve my parents from some financial distress, I tried to make my own money. I took every opportunity to make crafts or sweets to sell to those in my community at school as well as in my neighborhood. I hosted a lot of bake sales and yard sales to help raise money to get the toys and things I wanted. I was a part of a lot of volunteer clubs in high school (Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, Interact, and Allies) as well as our schoolâ€™s Associative Student Body. In all programs, I held the position of Treasurer, dealing with money for events and fundraisers around the school.<br><br> 
	
	      My father always taught me how to budget starting from a young age. He would give me money for the week after approving my budget and taught me to keep track of my spendings in a journal. This way, I was able to restrict myself from buying unnecessary purchases and even to this day, I budget things out and keep track of my purchases in a journal. It taught me organization as well as the importance of prioritizing where my money goes.<br><br>
